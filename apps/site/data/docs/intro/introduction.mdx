## Overview

Tamagui brings joy to cross platform development. Use the core style library or any of the components in the tamagui UI kit independently or together. Styled or unstyled, with React Native and React Native Web, or without either.

#### Core

Core (`@tamagui/core`) is a fully-typed TypeScript [style + design system library](/docs/core/configuration),
a bit like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) or
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev). It supports a [large superset](/docs/intro/styles) of the the React
Native style API, bringing many nice web style APIs to React Native but with no
dependencies outside of `react` itself, it can also be a great choice for
websites and apps.

It weighs 24-28Kb depending on your configuration, but it can
emit near optimal 0-runtime React code with all CSS extracted at build time, and
with 100% [SSR](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr.html) safe code even for features like enterStyle animations.

#### Static

Static (`@tamagui/static`) is an [optimizing compiler for React](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler)
that emits 0-runtime, near optimal code for both web and native, even when faced
with logic-filled styles or styles that import values from other files. It was
forked from the great [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle) library.

#### Tamagui

Tamagui (`tamagui`) [is a suite of cross-platform React Native components](/docs/components/stacks) that can come in
styled or unstyled form.

It features novel components like Adapt, a primitive
that lets a component shapeshift their content into other forms depending on the
media query or platform and `native` props to adapt many components to their native counterparts.
